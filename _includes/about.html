        <p>Hey, I'm Alex. I'm a Scottish games programmer. My main exerience is with C++ and C#, and I've made games in Unreal, Unity, and Godot. I also have some art experience with modelling, animating and texturing in Blender. I enjoy creative problem solving and learning new things and I love any area of game dev where programming and art intersect.</p>
